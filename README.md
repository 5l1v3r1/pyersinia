What's pyersinia?
-----------------

Pyersinia is a similar tool to Yersinia, but Pyersinia is implemented in Python using Scapy. The main objective is the realization of network attacks such as spoofing ARP, DHCP DoS , STP DoS among others. The community can add new attacks on the tool in a simple way, using plugins. This is because Pyersinia uses the STB (Security Tools Builder) framework.
